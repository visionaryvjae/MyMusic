# MyMusic
This is a music player application on android with some moderate controls

The application can play and pause music, skip to the next and previous song, it can shuffle songs, it can repeat 1 singular song or play a single song
and stop playing altogether.

The application does have a search functions that can work by pressing the search button or via pressing enter on the keyboard.

The application does not create a mediasession as I am currently looking into in, so it will not respond to media buttons from bluetooth devices or headsets of any kind.
